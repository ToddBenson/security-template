Feature: Run header checks against a target

  Background:
    Given "curl" is installed
    And the following environment variables:
      | name     | environment_variable_name |
      | hostname | HOSTNAME |

  Scenario: Check for HTTP response headers
    When I launch a "curl" attack with:
    """
    ../../tests/headers/headers.sh <hostname>
    """
    Then the output should contain:
    """
    Headers NOT Found: 5\n
    """
